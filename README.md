# Rents: Rental Estate Navigation and Tracking System
The project is a Java-based rental management application for small businesses intended to make room rental procedures easier. It enables a landlord to manage his estate and tenants in a proper manner with transparency and straightforwardness in the operations. Add rooms, list room availability, rent rooms, vacate rooms, view tenant, and update tenant profiles are all functionalities in the application.
